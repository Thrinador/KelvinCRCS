                <h1>Installation/Setup</h1>
                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>Virtual reality requires special hardware to run. Currently ASL has the most built in tested support
                    for
                    SteamVR devices.
                    <br />
                    <b>Steam has the following as reccomended specifications for running SteamVR:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>OS:</b> Windows </li>
                    <li><b>Processor:</b> Intel i5-4590 / AMD FX 8350 equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> 4 GB RAM</li>
                    <li><b>Graphics:</b> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or greater</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The work machine in graduate lab features a GTX 1070, which is more than powerful enough given the
                    scope
                    of the assets in ASL and has been tested with the HTC Vive.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> You may experience technical difficulties with setting up the Occulus Rift on this PC
                    &amp;
                    it will not support the Windows Mixed Reality Devices</p>
                <p> ASL also has support for the Windows Mixed Reality Device using SteamVR, which has the following
                    requirments</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
                    <li><b>OS:</b> Windows 10 April 2018 Update</li>
                    <li><b>Processor:</b> Intel i5-4590 / AMD FX 8350 equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> 8 GB RAM</li>
                    <li><b>Graphics:</b> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>DirectX:</b> Version 11</li>
                    <li><b>Bluetooth:</b> Bluetooth 4.0 for accessories</li>
                </ul>
                <p> We have found that laptops with 8GB of RAM and a dedicated video card (GTX 9xxM series +) can get
                    by
                    running ASL with the Windows Mixed Reality Devices.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Natively the Windows Mixed Reality uses the Universal Windows Platform API, but
                    ASL does not currently support building toward that platform, so to use the Windows Mixed Reality
                    devices you need to install the following from Steam.</p>
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/719950/Windows_Mixed_Reality_for_SteamVR/">Windows Mixed
                    Reality for SteamVR</a>
                <p></p>

                <h2>VR Setup</h2>
                <p>For Vive setup follow <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2001-UXCM-4439">these
                        instructions</a></p>
                <p>For Windows Mixed Reality initially follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/before-you-start">these
                        instructions</a>
                    <br>Then procede to install SteamVR and Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR.</p>

                <h1>ASL Usage</h1>
                <h2>Virtual Reality Toolkit</h2>
                <p>ASL's support of VR devices is built on top of the <a href="https://vrtk.io/">Virtual Reality
                        Toolkit</a>.
                    The VRTK modules are sourced from the github repository, the version on the Unity store is outdated
                    and
                    will not work with ASL.</p>
                <p>VRTK is an open source framework designed to ease VR development and allow for easing support of
                    multiple devices. The following are some resources for using VRTK</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://vrtk-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/">Slack server for VRTK development</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://vrtoolkit.readme.io/docs/getting-started">VRTK documentation</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMz04CqAYjw&amp;list=PLTiD-q2AfVNJYGRdR9veojuO0t4v4idmI">Video
                            tutorials</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/quintesse/PlayoVR">Repository using PUN with VRTK</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Adding a VR player</h2>
                <p>Adding a VR player to a scene in ASL is rather trivial. Once a supported VR device is setup and
                    installed all that is required is for the
                    VR Player System prefab to be included in a scene, the VR device connected to the computer, and to
                    have
                    the appropriate version of SteamVR running.</p>
                <img width="300" src="./Summer 2018 ASL Documentation - Virtual Reality Tutorial_files/VRPrefab.png">
                <p>From the prefab you then select the supported device you would like to load and then press play.
                    This
                    will lead to the creation of a networked
                    avatar that will provide a visual representation of the VR player that is synchronized across ASL.</p>
                <img width="300" src="./Summer 2018 ASL Documentation - Virtual Reality Tutorial_files/networkedVRavatar.png">
                <h3>VR Player Types</h3>
                <p>Currently ASL supports a simulator VR player and a SteamVR player. In order to add support for a
                    device
                    the camera rig prefabs of an SDK setup is modified
                    to have reference points for the components of a networked VR avatar. The <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aluc4rd/ASL/api/ASL.VirtualReality/VRInitilizationScript/">VR
                        Initilization Script</a> will first create an instance of a networked avatar.
                    Upon creation the avatar the apppropriate VR scripts, based off of the selected device field, will
                    be
                    activated. After activiation GameObject references for the avatar will be found by the
                    initilization
                    script, which will call the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aluc4rd/ASL/api/ASL.VirtualReality/VRAvatarInitialization/304A0EE7.html">VRAvatarInitialization
                        initilize function.</a></p>
                <p>This process has already been implemented for SteamVR devices and the simulator.</p>
                <h2>Controlling a VR player</h2>
                <p>Interactions with VR input devices that control a VR player are located in the 'VRTK_Scripts'
                    GameObject. These scripts are implemented to support
                    any VR device supported by VRTK, given the appropriate SDK is included in the project (see SteamVR
                    and
                    OVR in 3rd Party Libraries). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IWAwFDhX2M&amp;list=PLTiD-q2AfVNK3g1fgaZ3Zgxjdl6rs6eP7">this
                        playlist</a> for an example of setting up these scripts.
                    Scenes in 'ASL/3rd Party Libraries/VRTK/Examples', specifically [004 - Locomotion] Teleporting
                    &amp;
                    [006 - Locomotion] MovementTypes should also be useful references for changing the way a VR player
                    is
                    controlled.</p>
                <h3>Simulator</h3>
                <p>The simulator emulates movement of the headset via the VRTK input simulator script. When a simulator
                    is
                    created there will be a GUI element displaying controls.</p>
                <img width="300" src="./Summer 2018 ASL Documentation - Virtual Reality Tutorial_files/SimulatorControls.png">
                <p> The current built in controls use WSAD for moving the playerspace/camera rig. The mouse moves the
                    direction the headset is oriented. You can follow the GUI to emulate buttons
                    press with keypresses to trigger teleportation.</p>
                <h3>SteamVR</h3>
                <p>When using an actual VR device you will interact with an additional movement option. The simulator
                    can
                    only move the orientation
                    of the headset. When using VR the camera will move in relation to your actual headset movement and
                    will
                    move with you relative to the playspace
                    and camerarig. However, when using SteamVR, you lose support for WSAD movement &amp; the existing
                    method of moving in the virtual scene outside of the
                    length of your VR playspace is to use the trigger buttons to teleport around.</p>
                <h3>Other devices</h3>
                <p>Other devices have yet to be implemented, but should control just like the SteamVR devices.</p>
