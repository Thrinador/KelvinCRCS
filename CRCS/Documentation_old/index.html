                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>Virtual reality requires special hardware to run. Currently ASL is made best for
                    SteamVR devices.
                    <br />
                    <h3>SteamVR</h3>
                    <b>Valve has the following recommended specifications for running SteamVR:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>OS:</b> Windows (10, 8.1, 7 SP1) </li>
                    <li><b>Processor:</b> Intel: i5-4590 / AMD: FX 8350, equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> 4 GB RAM</li>
                    <li><b>Graphics:</b> NVIDIA: GeForce GTX 970 / AMD: Radeon R9 290, equivalent or greater</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Tested Configuration: </i>The work machine in UWB's graduate lab features a GTX 1070, which is
                    more than powerful enough given
                    the
                    scope
                    of the assets in ASL.
                    <br />
                    It has been tested with the <b>HTC Vive.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Oculus Rift</h3>
                    <b>Oculus Rift has limited support, so there will be technical difficulties.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Windows Mixed Reality</h3>
                    <b>ASL also has support for Windows Mixed Reality Devices using SteamVR, which has the following
                        requirements:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <b>64-bit operating system required</b>
                    <li><b>OS:</b> Windows 10, April 2018 Update</li>
                    <li><b>DirectX:</b> Version 11+</li>
                    <li><b>Processor:</b> Intel: i5-4590 / AMD: FX 8350, equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>Memory:</b> 8 GB RAM</li>
                    <li><b>Graphics:</b> NVIDIA: GeForce GTX 970 / AMD: Radeon R9 290, equivalent or greater</li>
                    <li><b>Bluetooth:</b> Bluetooth 4.0 for accessories</li>
                </ul>
                <p> <i>Tested Configuration: </i>We have found that laptops with 8GB of RAM and a dedicated video
                    card (GTX 9xxM series +) can get
                    by
                    running ASL with the Windows Mixed Reality Devices.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b> Windows Mixed Reality uses the Universal Windows Platform API, which ASL currently does
                    not support. You will have to install SteamVR support
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/719950/Windows_Mixed_Reality_for_SteamVR/">with this
                        application.</a>

                    <h1>ASL Usage</h1>
                    <h2>Virtual Reality Toolkit</h2>
                    <p>ASL's support of VR devices is built on top of the <a href="https://vrtk.io/">Virtual Reality
                            Toolkit</a>.
                        The VRTK modules are sourced from the GitHub repository rather than the Unity version.
                        <br />
                        <b>Please use this version.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>VRTK is an open source framework designed to ease VR development and allow for easing support of
                        multiple devices.
                        <br />
                        The following are some resources for using VRTK:

                    <h2>Adding a VR player</h2>

                    <div class="image_step">
                        <p>Adding a VR player to a scene in ASL might be trivial. After setting up
                            a VR
                            device and
                            connecting it to the computer, <b>include a 'VR Player System' prefab into your scene</b>,
                            found inside the downloadable package. </p>

                    <div class="image_step">
                        <p>Then from the prefab select the supported device you would like to load on and press play.
                            This
                            will create a networked
                            avatar that will provide a visual representation of the VR player which is synchronized
                            across
                            ASL.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h3>VR Player Types</h3>
                    <p><b>Currently ASL has support for simulated and real SteamVR players.</b> In order to add support
                        for a
                        device
                        the camera rig prefabs of an SDK setup is modified
                        to have reference points for the components of a networked VR avatar. The <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aluc4rd/ASL/api/ASL.VirtualReality/VRInitilizationScript/">VR
                            Initilization Script</a> will first create an instance of a networked avatar.
                        Upon creation the avatar the apppropriate VR scripts, based off of the selected device field,
                        will
                        be
                        activated. After activiation GameObject references for the avatar will be found by the
                        initilization
                        script, which will call the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aluc4rd/ASL/api/ASL.VirtualReality/VRAvatarInitialization/304A0EE7.html">VRAvatarInitialization
                            initilize function.</a></p>
                    <p>This process has already been implemented for SteamVR devices and the simulator.</p>
                    <h2>Controlling a VR player</h2>
                    <p>Interactions with VR input devices that control a VR player are located in the '<i>VRTK_Scripts</i>'
                        GameObject. These scripts are implemented to support
                        any VR device supported by VRTK, given the appropriate SDK is included in the project (see
                        SteamVR
                        and
                        OVR in 3rd Party Libraries).
                        <br />

                        controlled.</p>

                    <div class="image_step">
                        <p>The simulator emulates movement of the headset via the VRTK input simulator script.

                            <br /> The current built in controls use WSAD for moving the playerspace/camera rig. The
                            mouse
                            moves
                            the

                                You can follow the GUI to emulate button

                    <h3>SteamVR</h3>
                    <p>When using a SteamVR device you will be able to duck and jump. The
                        simulator
                        can
                        only move the horizontal orientation
                        of the headset. When using VR the camera will move in relation to your actual headset movement
                        and
                        will
                        move with you relative to the playspace
                        and camerarig.
                        <br />
                        <b>
                            However, when using SteamVR, you lose the ability to move with the WASD keys. To move
                            outside
                            of your
                            own playspace, use the triggers to teleport to a location.

                    <h3>Other devices</h3>
                    <p>Other devices have yet to be implemented, but should control just relatively similar to SteamVR
                        devices.</p>
